<color cyan>- Fixed sprite selection improved</color>: Now you will use it like a parameter, supporting the image related protocols listed above.
<color cyan>- Vehicle picker</color>: Now you don't need to find the vehicle name in the list anymore, just press the dropper button then click at desired vehicle

<color cyan>- Font character support</color>: Now even not supported characters for some fonts (like accented letters) will try to fallback to a existing character (like the regular letter in case of accents). If N/A, will be removed from string, not occupying a letter space anymore.
